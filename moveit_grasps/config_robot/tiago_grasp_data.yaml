    # grasp_depth_resolution is the discretization distance in meter used for sampling the grasp depth value.

    # A grasp motion is composed of three linear paths: approach, retreat, lift
    # The values below define the desired distances of each path.

    # We need to know the transform from the arm IK link to the grasp point. By default we define the transform manually with
    # `tcp_to_eef_mount_transform`. Alternatively, we can set this to a frame in the robot model (grasping frame) and compute the transform
    # automatically. this is done by setting `define_tcp_by_name: true` and providing a value for `tcp_name`.

    # Distance from the eef mount to the palm of end effector [x, y, z, r, p, y]

    # If we have a tool center point frame, we would set:
    define_tcp_by_name: true
